# What is Programming Language?

A prgramming language us a formal language that prvides instructions for a computers to execute. It's how humans communicate with computers to create software, applications, and other technology.


# High Level Language Vs Low level Programming Language

**Low Level** : Machine only understand binary language / assembly language / low level language.  01010101

**High Level Language** Humans can understand like Python, C ++, Java


Computers can not undersatnd **high level language** so we need to convert high level language into **low level lanaguage** or binary language

Complier and Interoreter 

# Complier 

1. ## **Complier** converts whole code high level language  at a once into low level language.

2. **Errors at once**

3. Slow in analyze
4 . compiled code run fast

# Interpreter
1. ## **Interpreter** converts code line by line.
2. **Errors line by line**

3. Fast in Analyze 


# Introduction to Python

**Python** is a versatile high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for readablity and ease of use.


1. Interpreted
2. High-Level
3. Object-oriented
4. Extensive libraries
5. Beginner-friendly
