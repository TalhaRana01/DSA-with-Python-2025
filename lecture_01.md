# 1. What is Programming Language?

A prgramming language us a formal language that prvides instructions for a computers to execute. It's how humans communicate with computers to create software, applications, and other technology.


# 2. High Level Language Vs Low level Programming Language

**Low Level** : Machine only understand binary language / assembly language / low level language.  01010101

**High Level Language** Humans can understand like Python, C ++, Java


Computers can not undersatnd **high level language** so we need to convert high level language into **low level lanaguage** or binary language

# 3. Complier and Interoreter 

# Complier 

1. ## **Complier** converts whole code high level language  at a once into low level language.

2. **Errors at once**

3. Slow in analyze
4 . compiled code run fast

# Interpreter
1. ## **Interpreter** converts code line by line.
2. **Errors line by line**

3. Fast in Analyze 


# 4. Introduction to Python

**Python** is a versatile high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for readablity and ease of use.


1. Interpreted
2. High-Level
3. Object-oriented
4. Extensive libraries
5. Beginner-friendly

# 5.  Varibles/Keywords/Identifiers/Comments/


1. **Variables**

Container that store data in computer memory

**Keywords**
Predefined words that having any meaning in Programming Language
1. `while`
2. `def`
3. `for`
4. `if`

**Identifiers**
Name that we provide to variables/functions/class
1. variables names for declaring 
2. functions names
3. class names

**Comments**
you can use comments for understading the codes. its not executable code
1. Single line comments  # This is a single line comments
2. Multi-Line comments  ""This is multi line comments""

**Operators**

Arithemic Operators:
1. Addition `+`
2. Substraction -`
3. Division `/`
4. Mudulus `%`
5. Floor division `//`
6. Exponentiation `**`
7. Muliplication `*`

**Assignment Operators**

Used to assign values to variables.
1. `=` (Assign)
2. `+=` (add and assign)
3. `_=` (Subtract and assign)
4. `*=` (Multiply and assign)

**Comperison Operators**

1. `==` (Equal to)
2. `!=` (not equal to)
3. `">`(Greater than)
4. `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
5. `<=` (Less than or equal to)


**Logical Operators**
Used to combine to conditional statements.

1. `and` (Logical AND)
2. `or` (Logical OR)
3. `not` (Logical Not)


**Membership Operators**

Used to check if a value is a part of a sequence

1. `in` (Returns True if a value is found in the sequence)
1. `not in` (Returns True if a value is  not found in the sequence)
