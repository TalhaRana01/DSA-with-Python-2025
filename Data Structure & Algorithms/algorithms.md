# What is Algorithms ?

## ```A process of set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations especially by computer```

## ```Algo is all about solution to specific problem in software```





# Why Algorithms so important?
**Each software devlopment have specific purpose to solve problems like playing songs, movies**

## **Step 1. Identify the Purpose or specific Problem** 
# ```Software write krnay ka koi na koi purpose ya problem solving hogi```

## ``` Software development ka koi na koi maqsad hota ha kisi bhi problem ko hal kiya jaye. jb humhan software development ka purpose ya maqsad pta chal jaye to phir hum us specific problems ko hal krny ky liye software write krty hain  ya hum khud koi software write krty hain jo koi na ko problems solve ya specific kam kry ga ```

## **Step 2. Solution for Problem (Agorithms)** 

## ``` Particular software ko write krny sy phley hum real time logical possibilities likhty hain kesa software hoga kia kia functionalities hon hn kesa design hoga .```

## **Step 3. Building the Program or writing software** 

## ``` Jab problem samjh agai or hum ny uska solution likh liya us ky bad hum software development start krain ge.```
