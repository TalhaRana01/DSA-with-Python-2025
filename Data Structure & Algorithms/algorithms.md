# What is Algorithms ?

## ```Algorithm is a process or a set of well-defined rules or steps to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. In simple terms: An algorithm is a sequence of steps designed to solve a specific problem in software.```

## ```Algo is all about solution steps to specific problem in software```

## ```Kisi bhi problem ko solve karne ke liye ek ya zyada steps liye ja sakte hain — kabhi aik step hota hai, kabhi hazaron steps bhi ho sakte hain.```





# Why Algorithms so important?
**Each software devlopment have specific purpose to solve problems like playing songs, movies**

## **Step 1. Identify the Purpose or specific Problem** 
# ```Explanation: Every software is created to solve a particular problem or to achieve a specific purpose.```

## ```Har software likhne ka koi na koi purpose hota hai — ya to kisi problem ko solve karna, ya koi specific task perform karna.Jab humein software development ka maqsad samajh aa jata hai, tab hum us specific problem ke solution ke liye software likhte hain — ya khud koi software design karte hain jo kisi khas kaam ya problem ko solve kare.```

## **Step 2. Solution for the Problem (Agorithms)** 

## ``` Software likhne se pehle hum logical steps likhte hain — ke software kaisa hoga, usme kaunsi functionalities hongi, aur wo problem ko kaise solve karega. Yehi algorithm kehlata hai..```

## **Step 3. Building the Program or writing software** 

## ```Jab problem samajh aajati hai aur hum uska solution (algorithm) likh lete hain, to phir hum software development start karte hain — yani code likhna aur program banana.```
