## Why are Data Structure and Algorithms important?

**Myth**: you can build software using only programming language

**As a Developer :** we must know about data structure, and algorithons for building efficient software.


**Data Structure :**  means organized Data

**Algorithm :** Process on Data | Task performing on Data

1. To build an efficient program.
2. Easy to write a program or logic of program.
3. To increase Program execution Speed.
4. To Reusebility of Data.
5. To improve Abstraction of Program.
6. To Solve Real World Problems.
