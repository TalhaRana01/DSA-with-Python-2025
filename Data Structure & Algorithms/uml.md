# What is Unified Modeling UML?

1. UML stands for Unified Modeling Language.
2. UML is a graphical language for software visualizing, software specifying, software constructing, and documenting information about software system  as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.
3. UML can be used for modeling a system independent of the plateorm language.


1. UML gives a standard way to write a system model, covering conceptuals ideas.

2. With an understanding of the modeling, the use and application of UML can make the software development process more efficient.

3. Some UML tools generate program language code from UML.

4. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flows or errors in software or business processes

# Types of UML Diagrams?
1. **Structural Diagram.**(Static View of Software without any events/activiites)
    Structural digram are used to represent a static view of a system. It represents a part of a system that makes up the structure of a system.
2. **Behavioral Diagram.**
    Any real-world system can be represented in either a static form, or dynamic form. A system is said to be complete if it is expressed in both the static and dynamic ways. The Behavioral diagram represents functioning of a system.
    Following are the various behavioral diagram in UML.
    1. Activity diagram
    2. Use-case diagram
    3. Static machine diagram
3. **Interaction Diagram.**
    Interaction digram is nothing but subset of a behavioral diagrams. It is used visualize the flow between various use case elements of a system.Interaction diagram are used to show an interaction between two entities and data flows within them.
    
     1. Communcation diagram
     2. Interaction overview 
     3. Timing diagram
